This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) that document my journey through Kaggle's Machine Learning and Deep Learning exercises.

## Environment Setup

These notebooks are intended to be run on Kaggle. If you wish to run them locally, make sure you have activated the required environment using Conda:

```bash
conda activate sklearn-env
```

## Adding a New Package

If you need to add a new package, use the following commands:

```bash
# Using conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge <package>
```

##### **Comment:**<br> This repository contains a collection of introductory notebooks and forked tutorials from other Kagglers exploring Machine Learning, with a focus on Deep Learning. I'm using Kaggle to learn and practice my skills in these fields. The repository is primarily maintained through Kaggle, not GitHub, so there may be discrepancies in content. To view the original code, visit my Kaggle profile [here](https://www.kaggle.com/patimejia/code).
