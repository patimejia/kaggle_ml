The objective was to minimize the cost of changing channels and links.\n\nThis notebook showcases a solution to the Santa optimization problem. The solution includes creating a submission file for the competition using either a greedy algorithm or an A-star algorithm to find the shortest path. However, no heuristic function or prioritization was implemented.\n\nCurrently, the submitted file contains a simple solution for the entire eight-link arm. While a better algorithm exists, it requires a significant amount of time to run, and further learning is necessary to implement it effectively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Welcome to *The Christmas Card Conundrum*! #\n\nEach year Kaggle hosts a special Santa-themed optimization challenge.

However, it is still too slow to run on the full eight-link arm. A better algorithm would be to use a heuristic function to prioritize the nodes in the open list. Or a faster algorithm could be used to find the neighbors of the current node..\n\nAn algorith to find the neighbors of the current node could be to use a breadth-first search algorithm. It works by finding the neighbors of the current node, then finding the neighbors of the neighbors of the current node, and so on. However, it is still too slow to run on the full eight-link arm.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nA good model will be able to find the shortest path between the start and end points without collision. ***The goal is to minimize the cost of changing channels and links***.\n\nIn this notebook, we have seen how to create a simple solution to the Santa optimization problem. We have also seen how to create a submission file for the competition. We have used either a greedy algorithm or an A-star algorithm to find the shortest path, but we have not used any heuristic function or prioritization.\n\nFor now, the submitted file is the simple solution for the full eight-link arm, as the better algorithm takes a lot of time to run and more learning is necessary.","metadata":{}}]}
