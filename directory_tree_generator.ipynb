The function allows you to specify the maximum depth of the tree, whether to include files in the tree, how to sort the items in the tree, and the maximum number of items to display at each level.\n","\n","## Conclusion:\n","This function can be useful for quickly visualizing the structure of a directory and its subdirectories.\n","\n","## Code: (see above üîù)\n","\n","## Explanation of code:\n","\n","- The `get_directory_tree` function takes several arguments:\n","  - `start_path`: The path to start generating the directory tree from.\n","  - `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the tree to generate.\n","  - `include_files`: Whether to include files in the tree.\n","  - `sort_by`: How to sort the items in the tree. Can be one of `'name'`, `'size'`, `'date'`, or `'type'`.\n","  - `reverse`: Whether to reverse the order of the sorted items.\n","  - `max_items`: The maximum number of items to display at each level of the tree.\n","- The function uses the `os.scandir` function to get a list of items in a directory.\n","- The `get_items` function filters and sorts the list of items based on the arguments passed to `get_directory_tree`.\n","- The `print_tree` function recursively generates the directory tree by calling itself on each subdirectory.\n","- The final lines of code demonstrate how to use the `get_directory_tree` function and print out the resulting directory tree.\n","\n","### Examples\n","Change the last print statement to customize the output of the directory tree:\n","\n","1.
