Do you need these for deep learning?\n","\n","   - Lots of math T / F\n","   - Lots of data T / F\n","   - Lots of expensive computers T / F\n","   - A PhD T / F\n","\n","<br> R: You need lots of data and math, but not a PhD. A PhD will help you do research, but it's not necessary to use a deep learning method.\n","   \n","1. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.\n","<br> R: Deep learning is now the best in the world in the following areas:\n","   - Image classification\n","   - Natural language processing\n","   - Speech recognition\n","   - Recommendation systems\n","   - Generative adversarial networks\n","1. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?\n","<br> R: The name of this device is sometimes called a \"perceptron\".\n","1. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?\n","<br> R: The requirements for PDP are:\n","   - Parallelism: The system must process information in parallel.\n","   - Distribution of representations: The system must distribute representations for information throughout the system.\n","   - Propagation of activity: The system must propagate activity through the system.\n","   - Localist coding: The system must use localist representations.\n","1. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?\n","<br> R: The two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks were:\n","   - The assumption that the brain was a digital computer.\n","   - The assumption that the brain was a linear system.\n","1. What is a GPU?\n","<br> R: A GPU is a graphics processing unit, which is a specialized processor for handling graphics. The most advanced GPUs is the NVIDIA Tesla V100, which is a GPU that is optimized for deep learning. Other GPUs are optimized for gaming, and are not as good for deep learning.\n","1. Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: `1+1`. What happens?\n","<br> R: The cell will execute and the result will be 2.\n","1. Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.\n","<br> \n","1. Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.\n","<br>\n","\n","1. Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?\n","<br> R: It is hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo because it is hard to write a program that tells a computer how to recognize an image in a photo. There are many transformations that can be applied to an image, and it is hard to write a program that can recognize an image after it has been transformed.\n","1. What did Samuel mean by \"weight assignment\"?\n","<br> R: Samuel meant by \"weight assignment\" is that the weights are the numbers that are multiplied by the inputs to produce the output.\n","1. What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called \"weights\"?\n","<br> R: The term that we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called \"weights\" is \"parameters\".\n","1. Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel's view of a machine learning model.\n","<br> R: This is a picture that summarizes Samuel's view of a machine learning model:\n","   - The inputs are the x's.\n","   - The outputs are the y's.\n","   - The weights are the w's.\n","   - The bias is the b.\n","   It shows how the inputs are multiplied by the weights, and then the bias is added to produce the output. A formula for this is:\n","   y = w * x + b\n","   and a python plot  of this is:\n","   ```python\n","   def f(x): return x*w+b\n","   ```\n","1. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n","<br> R: It is hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction because the model is a black box. We don't know what the model is doing inside, so we can't understand why it makes a particular prediction.\n","1. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?\n","<br> R: The name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy is the **Universal Approximation Theorem**.\n","1. What do you need in order to train a model?\n","<br> R: You need a loss function and some data. The loss function tells you how good your model is, and the data is what you use to train your model. You also need a way to update the parameters of your model, which is called an optimizer. The optimizer is the algorithm that you use to update the parameters of your model. The optimizer is usually called `opt`.\n","1. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?\n","<br> R: A feedback loop could impact the rollout of a predictive policing model by causing the model to be biased towards the data that it is given. For example, if the model is used to predict which people are likely to commit crimes, and then the police arrest those people, then the model will be biased towards predicting that those people are likely to commit crimes. This is because the model is being trained on the data that it is given, and the data that it is given is biased towards the people that the police arrest. \n","1. Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?\n","<br> R: No, we don't always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model. We can use any size of image, but the model will be trained on 224×224-pixel images, so it will work best with images that are the same size as the images that it was trained on.\n","1. What is the difference between classification and regression?\n","<br> R: Classification is when the output is a category, and regression is when the output is a number. For example, if you are trying to predict whether a photo is a picture of a cat or a dog, then this is a classification problem. If you are trying to predict the price of a house, then this is a regression problem.\n","1. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n","<br> R: A validation set is a set of data that you use to check how well your model is doing. A test set is a set of data that you use to check how well your model is doing, but you only use it once. You use the validation set to check how well your model is doing while you are training it, and you use the test set to check how well your model is doing after you have finished training it. You need them because you need to check how well your model is doing, and you need to check how well your model is doing on data that it hasn't seen before.\n","1. What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?\n","<br> R: If you don't provide a validation set, fastai will split the training set into a training set and a validation set. The validation set will be 20% of the training set.\n","1. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n","<br> R: We can't always use a random sample for a validation set. We can't always use a random sample for a validation set because we need to check how well our model is doing on data that it hasn't seen before. If we use a random sample for a validation set, then we are checking how well our model is doing on data that it has seen before, and this is not a good way to check how well our model is doing. \n","1. What is overfitting? Provide an example.\n","<br> R: Overfitting happends when your model is too good at predicting the training set. For example, if you have a model that is trained to recognize cats, and it is so good at recognizing cats that it can recognize cats that are in the training set, but it can't recognize cats that are not in the training set, then this is overfitting.\n","1. What is a metric? How does it differ from \"loss\"?\n","<br> R: A metric is a way to measure how well your model is doing. It is different from \"loss\" because \"loss\" is a way to measure how well your model is doing, but it is only used while you are training your model. A metric is used to measure how well your model is doing after you have finished training your model. \n","1. How can pretrained models help?\n","<br> R: Pretrained models can help because they have already been trained on a lot of data, so they are already good at recognizing images. This means that you don't have to train your model on a lot of data, and you can use a smaller dataset to train your model.\n","1. What is the \"head\" of a model?\n","<br> R: The \"head\" of a model is the part of the model that is added on to the pretrained model. The pretrained model is the part of the model that is already trained, and the \"head\" is the part of the model that is added on to the pretrained model. For example, if you are using a pretrained model to recognize cats, then the pretrained model is the part of the model that is already trained to recognize cats, and the \"head\" is the part of the model that is added on to the pretrained model to recognize cats.\n","1. What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?\n","<br> R: The early layers of a CNN find features that are very simple, like lines and edges. The later layers of a CNN find features that are more complex, like eyes and ears.\n","1. Are image models only useful for photos?\n","<br> R: Image models are not only useful for photos. They are also useful for videos, and they are also useful for text. \n","1. What is an \"architecture\"?\n","<br> R: An \"architecture\" is the way that the layers of a model are connected together. For example, if you have a model that has a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer, then this is an \"architecture\". Other examples of \"architectures\" are ResNet and Inception. \n","1. What is segmentation?\n","<br> R: Segmentation is when you try to predict what each pixel in an image is. For example, if you are trying to predict what each pixel in an image is, then this is segmentation. It is important to note that segmentation is different from classification. Classification is when you try to predict what category an image is, and segmentation is when you try to predict what each pixel in an image is. This is an important problem because it is useful for self-driving cars, and it is useful for medical imaging.\n","1. What is `y_range` used for? When do we need it?\n","<br> R: `y_range` is used for regression. We need it when we are trying to predict a number, and we need it when we are trying to predict a number that is not between 0 and 1. For example, if we are trying to predict the price of a house, then we need `y_range` because the price of a house is not between 0 and 1. If it is between 0 and 1, then we don't need `y_range` and we use `sigmoid_range` instead or a loss function that is designed for regression like `MSELossFlat` or `L1LossFlat` or `SmoothL1LossFlat` or `HuberLossFlat`.\n","1. What are \"hyperparameters\"?\n","<br> R: Hyperparameters are the parameters that you can change when you are training your model. For example, the learning rate is a hyperparameter. Another example of a hyperparameter is the number of epochs. Other examples of a hyperparameter is the batch size, optimizer, loss function, and metrics.\n","1. What's the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?\n","<br> R: The best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization is to make sure that you have a good understanding of the data that you are using to train your model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6ca867e1","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001647,"end_time":"2023-07-13T06:06:19.547323","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-13T06:06:19.545676","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Further Research"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f35b2385","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001772,"end_time":"2023-07-13T06:06:19.550972","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-13T06:06:19.5492","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["1. Why is a GPU useful for deep learning? How is a CPU different, and why is it less effective for deep learning?\n","<br> R: A GPU is useful for deep learning because it is good at doing a lot of calculations at the same time. A CPU is different because it is not good at doing a lot of calculations at the same time. This is why it is less effective for deep learning. CPUs are good at doing one thing at a time, but GPUs are good at doing a lot of things at the same time. C stands for central, and P stands for processing. G stands for graphics, and P stands for processing.\n","1. Try to think of three areas where feedback loops might impact the use of machine learning.
